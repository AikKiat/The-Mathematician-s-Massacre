# The Mathematician's Massacre

![mathamaticianmassacre](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47acda53-05db-4a36-b1fa-71a6e7ea9bca)

## See the numbers, classify them with style. Slaughter the enemies. Learning Mathematics, made easy.

## How this game works:
<p>Created using Tkinter and Standard Python libraries, we have 5 vertical lanes where animated gifs of running stickman will traverse from the top to the end of the screen. Each of these figures is tagged with a number be it positive, negative, even, odd or prime. Of course, these catergories overlap so it is perfectly alright to classify a number as both positive and odd, or negative and even for example.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Keys 1,2,3,4,5 correspond to the respective classification types stated above. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Press any right one to fire the laser <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15baf868-8e0d-463f-9a99-13b5f6be75ed" style= "width:3rem; height:2rem" >, and blast the stickman carrying that number to oblivion. Fail, and they run free! <br/>No one wants that, right?
  </li>
</ul>

## Features
<ul>
  <li>Internal Game "clock" or timer that controls the running state of the game</li>
  <li>Animated gif system using individual images, and having the timer counter loop through each of them to play them one at a time</li>
  <li>Kill Streak bar that fills up as more stickmen are slaughtered. Once the streak bar is full, animated skull heads spawn and cackle with delight. <img style = "width: 3rem; height: 3rem;" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/364c28e8-ad2e-4459-9c99-5cbc3ad94393"></li>
  <li>Fully custom sound effects and voiceovers, playing at random and in accordance to a separate timer clock that controls when they should be played and for how long</li>
  <li>Simple user welcome sign in page</li>
  <li>
      Difficulty system where numbers get progressively harder to classify 
  </li>
</ul>
